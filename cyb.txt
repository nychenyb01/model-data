This process outlines the logic for a quality assurance (QA) sampling and variance check, based on two main evaluation types: random call monitoring and high-risk call monitoring.

1. Define Data Sources
The process uses specific files for different months (e.g., Aug 2024, Oct 2024) to find the full population of calls. Two separate sets of files are used:

· "M1-Random" calls are sampled from their respective monthly population files.
· "High Risk Monitor" calls are sampled from a different set of monthly high-risk population files.

2. Perform Sampling & Aggregation
Data is aggregated monthly for each QA reviewer (M2) and their associated sampling analyst (M1). Key counts are calculated, including:

· Total number of calls reviewed by M2.
· Counts of satisfactory and unsatisfactory outcomes.
· Number of variance cases (where M1 and M2 scores differ).
· Counts of Random and High-Risk calls sampled.

3. Apply Quality Control Checks
A series of exception flags are generated to validate the sampling and review process:

· Exception 3: Flags a case as "Y" if an M2 reviewer did not assess exactly 5 calls in a month.
· Exception 4: Flags a case as "Y" if the variance rate (disagreement between M1 and M2 scores) for a reviewer exceeds 10%.
· Exception 5: Flags a case as "Y" if an M2 reviewer's monthly sample contains zero calls from either the "Random" pool or the "High Risk Monitor" pool. The sample must include both types.

4. Generate Output
The final summary statistics, including all calculated counts and exception flags, are saved to the file: "A&A output strategy QA01.xlsx".
