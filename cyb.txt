This process validates whether the sampling of calls for quality monitoring (M1 review) meets established business rules across different teams and staff levels.

Step 1: Consolidate and Categorize Call Samples
Call data from four different periods is combined into a single list. Each call is categorized by team type (e.g., Secured/Unsecured, DCA, Legal/Restructure) and tagged with a duration type ("Too Short," "Normal," or "Too Long") based on specific time thresholds unique to each team's expected call length.

Step 2: Analyze Sampling per Staff Member
For each staff member (Collector) in a given month and team, the process calculates:

· Total number of their calls selected for M1 review.
· Counts of calls in each duration type category (short, normal, long).

Step 3: Apply Sampling Threshold Rules
A required sample count (M1_check_threshold) is determined for each staff member based on two factors:

1. Job Band: "Band 7" staff require 5 calls per month. "Band 6" staff require 2 calls per quarter.
2. New Hire Status: Staff within their first six months of employment require an additional 2 calls for monitoring, added to their standard threshold.

Step 4: Generate Validation Flags
Four key exception flags are created to identify gaps in the sampling process:

· Exception 1: Flagged as "Y" if the actual number of calls sampled from a staff member (M1_Check_Count) does not equal their required threshold (M1_check_threshold).
· Exception 2: Flagged as "Y" if the actual number of calls sampled (M1_Check_Count) is less than the required threshold (M1_check_threshold).
· Exception 3: Flagged as "Y" if the distribution of call durations for a set of 5 samples does not meet the expected mix (e.g., 1 short, 1 long, 3 normal calls). For "Band 6" staff or if the sample size isn't 5, this check is not applied (NA).
· Exception 4: Flagged as "Y" if the total volume of M1 reviews for a team/period does not match the volume of secondary M2 reviews, unless the M2 review count is exactly 5.

Step 5: Generate Output
The final analysis, including all calculated counts and the four exception flags, is saved to the file: "A&A output strategy QA06.xlsx".
