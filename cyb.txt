The logic can be described as follows:

First, data is loaded from the source file named "2.19.1_cessation list_202408-202507(updated with state and status).xlsx".

A customer is identified if their cessation reason is one of the following: Serious Illness, CSSA, Imprisonment, or Special Customer Handling.

Two exception flags are then created based on this list:

1. Exception 1 is flagged as "Y" if an identified customer has a blank next review date. Otherwise, it is "N".
2. Exception 2 is flagged as "Y" if an identified customer meets all of the following criteria: they have a next review date that is not blank, that date is after July 31, 2025, and their overall status in the file is "in cessation". Otherwise, it is "N".

The final result with these exception flags is saved in the output file "A&A output strategy 03.xlsx".
