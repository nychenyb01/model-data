This process (Strategy 27) creates a consolidated customer account view by merging data from two key dates: June 30 and July 31. The logic is as follows:

Step 1: Load Source Data
Data is loaded from a single master Excel file (cacs collections accounts as of 30JUN and 31JUL25 all products.xlsx), which contains separate sheets for different product types (Unsecured Loan, Card, PLGS Loan, Mortgage) for each of the two months.

Step 2: Process June 30th Data

· Data from the four product sheets for June 30th is combined into one dataset.
· The Product Type field is updated for special cases:
  · Mortgage accounts marked with GHOS are labeled as Mortgage-GHOS.
  · Loan accounts marked with PLGS are labeled as Loan-PLGS.

Step 3: Process July 31st Data

· The same process is repeated for the July 31st data sheets, combining them and updating the Product Type field with the GHOS and PLGS identifiers.

Step 4: Merge into a Single Account View

· The June and July datasets are merged together using the Account Number as the key, ensuring all accounts from both periods are included.
· Static customer information fields (like Product, ID) are consolidated so that if the information is present in one month's data but missing in the other, the available information is used to fill the gap.
· Key performance indicators for both months—such as outstanding balance, delinquency status (DPD), and queue status—are retained side-by-side for comparison.
· The FPD and PVC indicators are kept for both months to track any potential changes over time.

Step 5: Generate Output
The final, unified dataset is saved as the output file: "A&A output strategy 27.xlsx". This file provides a complete, account-level snapshot comparing status and movement across the two-month period.
