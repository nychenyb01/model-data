This process outlines a compliance check (Strategy 15) to ensure all contact attempts (calls, SMS, letters) with cross-border customers adhere to specific regional regulations and internal policies. The logic for each check is summarized below.

Step 1: Load and Prepare Data

· Call Records and Phone Flag Data are loaded and merged. The phone data identifies the customer's country.
· Time Zone Adjustment: For analysis, call times to customers in the UK and Australia are converted to their local time (UK: -7 hours from HK; AUS: +2 hours from HK) to accurately assess "business hour" compliance.

Step 2: Apply Country-Specific Contact Rules
Five core checks are performed to flag potential violations:

· Exception 1.1 (US Calls): Any phone call made to a customer located in the United States is flagged.
· Exception 1.2 (Off-Hours Calls): Any outbound call to customers in Canada, UK, or Australia made outside their local business hours (9 AM - 5 PM), on a weekend, or on a public holiday is flagged.
· Exception 1.3 (UK Call Frequency): For UK customers, an outbound call is flagged if either: more than 5 calls are made to the same customer on a single day, OR calls are made on more than 15 days within a 30-day cycle.
· Exception 1.4 (AUS Call Frequency): For Australian customers, an outbound call is flagged if either: more than 3 calls are made in a week, OR more than 10 calls are made in a month.
· Exception 1.5 (Mainland China Call Frequency): For Mainland Chinese customers (identified by phone number prefix '86'), a call is flagged if more than 3 call attempts are made to the same customer within a single day.

Step 3: Check Cross-Border SMS & Letters

· Exception 2 (SMS): Any SMS sent to a cross-border customer is flagged.
· Exception 3 (Letter Frequency): For customers in Canada, UK, or Australia, a letter is flagged if more than 1 letter per week or more than 3 letters per month are sent to the same customer.

Step 4: Check Total Contact Attempts for Canada

· Exception 4 (CAN Total Contacts): For Canadian customers, any contact attempt (call, SMS, or letter) on a workday is flagged if the total number of contact attempts for that customer exceeds 6 on that same day.

Step 5: Generate Output
All contact records, along with the newly added exception flags (1.1 to 1.5, 2, 3, 4), are compiled and saved to the final report: "A&A output strategy 15.xlsx".
