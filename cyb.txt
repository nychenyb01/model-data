The process checks if any customer accounts that should be excluded from quality monitoring were accidentally included in the speech analysis call population. The logic is summarized below:

Step 1: Build the Call Population for Checking
A consolidated list of randomly monitored calls is created by extracting and combining data from four monthly files (Aug 2024, Oct 2024, Nov 2024, Feb 2025). Key identifiers like Contact ID, Employee ID, and PBN (account number) are standardized and kept for matching.

Step 2: Check Against the PVC Customer List

· A list of customers eligible for a Payment Vacation (PVC) is loaded from a previous strategy output file.
· The logic checks if any account numbers from this PVC list appear within the four-month random call population.
· Each account in the PVC list is flagged with an exception1 = "Y" if a match is found.

Step 3: Check Against the Customer Complaint List

· A register of customers who have submitted complaints is loaded.
· The logic checks if any of these complainants' account numbers are present in the random call population.
· Each account in the complaint list is flagged with an exception2 = "Y" if a match is found.

Step 4: Check Against the Restructured Loan List

· A list of customers with newly restructured loans is loaded.
· The logic checks if any of these accounts are also present in the random call population.
· Each account in the restructured list is flagged with an exception3 = "Y" if a match is found.

Step 5: Generate the Output
The three lists (PVC, Complaints, Restructured), now containing the new exception flags that indicate potential inclusion in the monitoring population, are compiled and saved into a single output file: "A&A output strategy QA02.xlsx".
