This process performs quality control checks on the staff assigned to call monitoring assessments (M1 and M2 reviewers) to ensure proper oversight and competency. The logic is applied separately to data from four different months (Aug, Oct, Nov 2024, and Feb 2025).

Step 1: Prepare Staff Reference Data
A master staff list is loaded, containing details like staff names, IDs, and their GCB band (a job grade level indicating seniority/competency).

Step 2: Perform Manager Segregation Check
For each reviewed call, the system flags an exception1 as "Y" if the M1 Manager and the M2 Manager are identified as the same person. This check ensures the required separation of duties in the review process.

Step 3: Perform Competency Hierarchy Check
For each reviewed call, the system flags an exception2 as "Y" if the hierarchy of job grades (GCB bands) is incorrect, based on these rules:

· The M2 reviewer's grade should not be higher than the M1 reviewer's grade.
· The M1 reviewer's grade should not be higher than the original collector's grade.
· The M2 reviewer's grade should not be higher than the original collector's grade.
  A flag is raised if any of these conditions are met, indicating a potential lapse in the appropriate review hierarchy.

Step 4: Generate Output
The results, including the original data and the two new exception flags, are compiled and saved into the final report: "A&A output strategy QA05.xlsx".
