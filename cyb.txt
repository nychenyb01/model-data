This process validates whether the required number of deceased or non-performing customer accounts are being reviewed each month.

Step 1: Consolidate Review Data
Review records are loaded from four separate quarterly files (Sep 2024, Dec 2024, Mar 2025, Jun 2025) and combined for analysis.

Step 2: Count Monthly Reviews
For each month, the process counts:

· M1 Reviews: The number of cases where the primary reviewer (M1) has provided comments and recommendations.
· M2 Reviews: The number of cases where the secondary reviewer (M2) has provided comments and recommendations.

Step 3: Apply Sampling Rules
The monthly counts are checked against the required sample sizes:

· Exception 1: Flagged as "Y" if the count of M1 reviews for a month is not equal to 5.
· Exception 2: Flagged as "Y" if the count of M2 reviews for a month is not equal to 3.

Step 4: Generate Output
The final data, with the review counts and the two exception flags, is compiled and saved to the output file: "A&A output strategy QA09.xlsx".
