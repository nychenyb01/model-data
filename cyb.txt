This process performs quality control checks on the staff reviewing deceased or non-performing accounts, based on data from four quarters (Sep 2024, Dec 2024, Mar 2025, Jun 2025).

Step 1: Prepare Reference Data
A master staff list is loaded that includes staff names, IDs, and their GCB band (a job grade/competency level).

Step 2: Consolidate Review Data
Quality assurance data for deceased/non-performing account reviews is loaded from four different quarterly files and combined into a single dataset.

Step 3: Perform Review Integrity Checks
Two key validation checks are performed for each reviewed case:

· Exception 1 (Segregation of Duties): Flagged as "Y" if the M1 Reviewer and the M2 Reviewer are identified as the same person. This ensures independent oversight in the review process.
· Exception 2 (Competency Hierarchy): Flagged as "Y" if the M2 Reviewer's GCB band (seniority level) is higher than the M1 Reviewer's GCB band. The logic requires that the secondary reviewer (M2) should not be more senior than the primary reviewer (M1) to maintain an appropriate review hierarchy.

Step 4: Generate Output
The final dataset, including the original review records and the two new exception flags, is saved to the output file: "A&A output strategy QA11.xlsx".
