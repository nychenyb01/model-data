This process performs quality control checks on staff reviewing non-CEM (Customer Experience Management) cases, based on data from four quarters (Sep 2024, Dec 2024, Mar 2025, Jun 2025).

Step 1: Prepare Reference Data
A master staff list is loaded that includes staff names, IDs, and their GCB band (a job grade/competency level).

Step 2: Perform Staff Validation Checks
For each review case in the quarterly datasets, the system retrieves and attaches detailed information about three staff members:

1. The Primary Reviewer (M1)
2. The Secondary Reviewer (M2)
3. The Original Case Handler (Collector)

Step 3: Apply Review Integrity Rules
Two key validation checks are performed:

· Exception 1 (Segregation of Duties): Flagged as "Y" if the M1 Reviewer and the M2 Reviewer are identified as the same person. This ensures independent oversight in the review process.
· Exception 2 (Competency Hierarchy): Flagged as "Y" if the hierarchy of job grades (GCB bands) is incorrect according to any of these rules:
  · The M2 reviewer's grade is higher than the M1 reviewer's grade.
  · The M1 reviewer's grade is higher than the original collector's grade.
  · The M2 reviewer's grade is higher than the original collector's grade.

Step 4: Generate Output
The final datasets for all four quarters, now containing staff details and the two exception flags, are compiled and saved to the output file: "A&A output strategy QA08.xlsx".
